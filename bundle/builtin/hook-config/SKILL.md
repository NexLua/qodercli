# Creating Hooks for Qoder CLI

This skill guides you through creating hooks — automated behaviors that
trigger on specific events like tool execution, session lifecycle, file
changes, and notifications. Hooks are configured in settings.json files.

## When to Use Hooks

Use hooks when you need:

- **Automated side effects** after tool execution (format, lint, test)
- **Guardrails** before tool execution (block protected files, detect secrets)
- **Notifications** when events occur (desktop alerts, webhooks)
- **Validation gates** that block or allow operations based on conditions
- **Session automation** at start, end, or compaction

**When NOT to use hooks:**

- One-off tasks (just do them directly)
- Complex multi-step workflows (use agents or skills instead)
- Anything that needs user interaction mid-execution

## Configuration Scopes

| Scope       | File                                 | Use Case                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Project** | `${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`         | Team-shared, version controlled  |
| **Local**   | `${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.local.json`   | Personal, not committed          |
| **User**    | `~/${QODER_USER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`       | Global across all projects       |

**Choose project** for team guardrails and standards.
**Choose local** for personal preferences and notifications.
**Choose user** for global behaviors across all projects.

## Configuration Format

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "<EventName>": [
      {
        "matcher": "<regex>",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/my-hook.sh",
            "name": "my-hook",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each event maps to an array of **hook definitions**. Each definition has:

| Field        | Required | Description                                         |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `matcher`    | No       | Regex filter (matches tool name for tool events)    |
| `hooks`      | Yes      | Array of hook handlers                              |
| `sequential` | No       | Run hooks in order instead of parallel              |
| `async`      | No       | Fire-and-forget, don't block the operation          |

### Hook Handler Fields

| Field           | Required     | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`          | Yes          | `command`, `http`, `prompt`, or `agent`                |
| `command`       | command type | Shell command to execute (or executable path in exec form, see below) |
| `args`          | No           | Optional argv array. When set, the hook runs in **exec form** — `command` is invoked directly without a shell. See "Exec form vs Shell form" below |
| `url`           | http type    | Webhook URL to POST to                                 |
| `prompt`        | prompt/agent | LLM prompt text                                        |
| `if`            | No           | Per-hook condition: `"ToolName(glob)"` or `"ToolName"` |
| `name`          | No           | Display name                                           |
| `timeout`       | No           | Seconds before timeout                                 |
| `statusMessage` | No           | Text shown in UI during execution                      |
| `async`         | No           | Run in background without blocking                     |
| `asyncRewake`   | No           | Background hook; exit code 2 wakes model               |
| `rewakeMessage` | No           | Override system-reminder prefix when asyncRewake hook blocks (exit 2). Only with `asyncRewake`. |
| `rewakeSummary` | No           | One-line summary (default `Stop hook feedback`) shown to user + model when asyncRewake hook blocks. Whitespace collapsed, capped at 300 chars. Only with `asyncRewake`. |

> **One-shot headless mode:** when no persistent consumer exists (e.g.
> `claude -p "fix bug"` with text output), `asyncRewake` hooks
> transparently degrade to **synchronous** execution. In this mode
> exit code 2 is treated as `decision: 'deny'` and `rewakeMessage` /
> `rewakeSummary` are ignored.
>
> SDK streaming (`--input-format stream-json`) and remote worker modes
> **do** support background asyncRewake — the persistent connection
> provides a consumer for rewake notifications.

Example asyncRewake hook with custom rewake text:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "bash /opt/security/scan.sh",
          "if": "Bash(git commit:*)",
          "asyncRewake": true,
          "rewakeMessage": "[security-scan] background review:",
          "rewakeSummary": "Commit security review found issues",
          "timeout": 300
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The hook script must `exit 2` (and write its diagnostic to `stderr` /
`stdout`) to actually wake the model with the configured prefix + summary.

## Hook Events

### Tool Events (matcher = tool name regex)

| Event                | When                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `PreToolUse`         | Before tool execution           |
| `PostToolUse`        | After successful tool execution |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After tool execution fails      |
| `PermissionRequest`  | Tool requests user permission   |

### Session & Agent Lifecycle

| Event           | When                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SessionStart`  | Session initializes                                           |
| `SessionEnd`    | Session tears down                                            |
| `SubagentStart` | Sub-agent session begins                                      |
| `SubagentStop`  | Sub-agent session ends                                        |
| `TeammateIdle`  | Teammate attempts to become idle                              |
| `Stop`          | Agent decides to stop                                         |
| `StopFailure`   | Agent encounters fatal error and must stop (notification-only) |
| `PreCompact`    | Before context compaction                                     |
| `PostCompact`   | After context compaction                                      |

`TeammateIdle` input includes `teammate_name` and `team_name`. Exit code 2
uses stderr as feedback. A JSON output with `decision: "deny"` or
`continue: false` also blocks the idle transition; `reason` or `stopReason`
provides the feedback text. The feedback is sent to the same teammate as a new
turn. The teammate is marked idle only after a later `TeammateIdle` evaluation
allows the transition.

### User, Config & Notification Events

| Event                | When                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `UserPromptSubmit`   | User submits a prompt           |
| `ConfigChange`       | Settings change at runtime      |
| `Notification`       | External notification arrives   |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | System instructions loaded      |

### File & Workspace Events

| Event            | When                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `CwdChanged`     | Working directory changes  |
| `FileChanged`    | Watched file changes       |
| `WorktreeCreate` | Git worktree created       |
| `WorktreeRemove` | Git worktree removed       |

### Task Events

| Event           | When                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `TaskCreated`   | Background task created       |
| `TaskCompleted` | Background task completes     |

## Handler Types

### Command (`type: "command"`)

Executes a shell command. Hook input arrives as JSON on **stdin**.
Output is parsed from **stdout** as JSON.

**Exit code semantics:**

| Exit Code | Meaning                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0         | Success — parse stdout as JSON   |
| 2         | Blocking deny — stderr is reason |
| Other     | Non-blocking error, execution continues |

**Stdin** receives the full hook input as JSON (fields vary by event):

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Edit",
  "tool_input": { "file_path": "src/app.ts", "old_string": "...", "new_string": "..." }
}
```

**Stdout** JSON output (all fields optional, but `hookSpecificOutput` requires `hookEventName`):

```json
{
  "decision": "allow",
  "reason": "Checks passed",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "Message injected into conversation"
  }
}
```

Note: outputs whose `hookSpecificOutput` lacks `hookEventName` are rejected with `hookSpecificOutput is missing required field "hookEventName"`. Match `hookEventName` to the event your hook is registered on.

**Placeholders and exec form.**

Placeholders like `${QODER_PROJECT_DIR}`, `${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and `${QODER_PLUGIN_DATA}` are exported as environment variables to the hook subprocess.

- Under `bash` shell form, the CLI does **not** pre-substitute placeholders — bash expands them at runtime. Prefer double-quoted form so paths containing spaces or shell metacharacters (`'`, `$`, backticks) parse as a single token:
  - Recommended: `"${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/hook.sh`
  - Not recommended (unquoted; subject to field splitting / globbing): `${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hook.sh`
- Under `powershell`, `${QODER_PROJECT_DIR}`, `${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and `${QODER_PLUGIN_DATA}` are substituted into the command template before invocation.
- **Exec form** (`args` is set): `command` is an executable path/name and each `args` element is one literal argv entry. The CLI invokes the binary directly (no shell), so no quoting, splitting, or globbing happens. Use it when `command` or args contain complex shell metacharacters and you don't need pipes/redirection/globs.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "/usr/bin/python3",
  "args": ["${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check.py", "--strict"]
}
```

Best for: scripts, linters, formatters, external CLI tools.

### HTTP (`type: "http"`)

POSTs hook input as JSON to the URL. Response parsed as JSON hook
output. Headers support `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/hooks",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" }
}
```

Best for: webhooks, external integrations, CI/CD triggers.

### Prompt (`type: "prompt"`)

Isolated single-turn LLM evaluation. The evaluator runs in a fresh LLM
session — it only receives your `prompt` text plus the current event JSON
(`tool_name`, `tool_input`, etc.), and returns a structured `{ ok, reason }`
decision.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "prompt": "Check if this commit message follows Conventional Commits (type(scope)?: subject). Return {\"ok\": true} or {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"...\"}.",
  "if": "Bash(git commit:*)"
}
```

**Context boundary.** The evaluator has **no access to the main conversation**: it cannot see prior tool calls, the main Agent's reasoning, files read earlier, or any state outside the current event. Write conditions that can be decided from the event itself. Rules that depend on conversation history cannot be evaluated reliably here — use a `command` hook with persistent state, or an `agent` hook that re-checks the filesystem.

Best for: lightweight semantic checks on the event's own data — e.g.
classifying a Bash command's intent, judging whether a commit message
follows Conventional Commits. Not for: rules that need to know what the
main Agent did earlier, or that require reading other files. For
deterministic checks (path regex, denylisted command, secret signature),
prefer `command`.

### Agent (`type: "agent"`)

Spawns a sub-agent with tool access (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, optionally
`Bash`, etc.) to investigate before returning `{ ok, reason }`.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "agent",
  "prompt": "Verify the edited file passes type checking. $ARGUMENTS",
  "tools": ["Bash", "Read"],
  "maxTurns": 10,
  "timeout": 120
}
```

**Context boundary.** Like `prompt`, the sub-agent runs in its own session
and **does not see the main conversation history**. The advantage over
`prompt` is tool access: it can read files, grep the codebase, and run
shell commands to verify real state. Use this when verification depends on
actual filesystem or test output — not as a way to "remember" what the
main Agent did earlier.

Best for: verification that requires inspecting the real codebase or
running checks (type-check after edit, run a linter, confirm a file
matches a pattern). Costs more tokens and time than `prompt`; reach for
`command` first if a deterministic script can do the job.

## The `if` Condition

Narrow when a hook fires within a matched definition:

```jsonc
{ "if": "Edit(*.ts)" }       // Only Edit calls on .ts files
{ "if": "Write(src/**)" }    // Only Write calls under src/
{ "if": "Bash" }             // Any Bash call
{ "if": "Bash(git commit:*)" } // Only `git commit` (with or without args)
```

Format: `"ToolName(glob_pattern)"` or `"ToolName"`.
The glob matches the tool's primary argument (typically a file path).

A trailing `:*` is treated as a **prefix rule**: `"git commit:*"` matches the
exact command `git commit` and any command that starts with `git commit `
(prefix + space + anything). For Bash, compound commands (`VAR=1 git commit`,
`ls && git commit`) are split via tree-sitter and each sub-command is tested
against the rule.

## Hook Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Determine the Behavior

Understand what the user wants:

- What should happen automatically?
- When should it trigger? (before/after tool use, session event, etc.)
- Should it block operations or just observe?
- Who needs it? (team or personal)

**Avoid interrogation loops.** Propose a concrete hook config based on
initial understanding and ask the user to refine.

### Step 2: Choose Event, Matcher, and Handler

Map the behavior:

| Behavior               | Event         | Matcher        | Handler | Notes                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Auto-format after edits| `PostToolUse` | `Edit\|Write`  | command | `if: "Edit(*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx})"` |
| Block protected files  | `PreToolUse`  | `Edit\|Write`  | command | —                              |
| Secret detection       | `PreToolUse`  | `Edit\|Write`  | command | —                              |
| Desktop notifications  | `Notification`| —              | command | `async: true`                  |
| Run tests after changes| `PostToolUse` | `Edit\|Write`  | command | —                              |
| Commit-message lint    | `PreToolUse`  | `Bash`         | prompt  | `if: "Bash(git commit:*)"`     |
| Classify risky Bash    | `PreToolUse`  | `Bash`         | prompt  | Narrow with `if` to avoid firing on every shell call |
| AI code review gate    | `PreToolUse`  | `Edit\|Write`  | agent   | —                              |
| Type-check verification| `PostToolUse` | `Edit\|Write`  | agent   | `if: "Edit(*.{ts,tsx})"`       |
| Webhook to CI/CD       | `PostToolUse` | `Edit\|Write`  | http    | —                              |
| Dependency guard       | `PreToolUse`  | `Edit`         | command | —                              |

**Choosing between command / prompt / agent.** Default to `command` —
it is the fastest, cheapest, and most predictable, and a regex or short
script handles most guardrails (secrets, protected paths, formatters).
Pick `prompt` only when the decision needs LLM-level semantic judgment
on the event's own data (e.g. classifying a Bash command's intent),
and remember the evaluator cannot see the rest of the session. Pick
`agent` when verification must inspect real files or run checks (type
check, linter, multi-file review); it has tools but still no
conversation history.

### Step 3: Choose Scope

- **Project** (`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`): Team standards, check in
- **Local** (`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.local.json`): Personal, not committed
- **User** (`~/${QODER_USER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`): Global, all projects

### Step 4: Create the Configuration

1. Read the target settings.json (if it exists)
2. Merge the new hook into the existing `hooks` object
3. Write back the file

If no hooks exist yet, create the full structure.

### Step 5: Create Script Files (command type)

For command hooks with non-trivial logic, create scripts in
`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks
```

Script requirements:
- Read JSON from stdin
- Write JSON to stdout (or nothing for simple success)
- Exit 0 for success, 2 for blocking deny, other for warning
- Use stderr for error messages and debug output
- Make executable: `chmod +x ${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/my-hook.sh`

Test independently:

```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"test.ts"}}' | \
  ${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/my-hook.sh
```

### Step 6: Verify

Tell the user to verify:

1. Restart the session or trigger the relevant event
2. Check the hook fires and produces expected output
3. Test the blocking path (for PreToolUse guards)
4. Confirm `async` hooks don't block the session

## Best Practices

1. **Keep hooks fast** — Target <5s for synchronous hooks
2. **Test scripts independently** — Pipe sample JSON stdin, verify output
3. **Use `async: true`** for non-blocking side effects (notifications, logging)
4. **Scope matchers narrowly** — Don't fire on every tool invocation
5. **Prefer `if` conditions** for file-type filtering
6. **Log to stderr** — stdout is parsed as JSON; debug output goes to stderr
7. **Handle edge cases** — Exit 0 if the condition doesn't apply
8. **Use `statusMessage`** for meaningful UI feedback during execution

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Overly broad matchers** — `".*"` on PreToolUse fires on every single tool call
- **Long synchronous hooks** — Block the entire interactive session
- **Stdout pollution** — Non-JSON stdout causes parse errors
- **Missing shebang** — Scripts without `#!/bin/bash` may fail silently
- **Session-aware conditions in `prompt` hooks** — The prompt evaluator only
  sees the current event and has no access to the conversation history.
  Rules that depend on what the main Agent did earlier cannot be
  evaluated; use `command` with persistent state, or `agent` that
  re-checks the filesystem instead.
- **`prompt` for jobs `command` can do** — If the rule is a deterministic
  pattern check (regex on a path, denylisted command, secret signature),
  use `command`. It is faster, cheaper, and reproducible.

## Examples

### Auto-Format TypeScript

Runs Prettier on TypeScript files after every Edit or Write.

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`:**

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/auto-format.sh",
        "if": "Edit(*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx})",
        "name": "auto-format",
        "statusMessage": "Formatting..."
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/auto-format.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
FILE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')
[ -z "$FILE" ] && exit 0
[ -f "$FILE" ] || exit 0
npx prettier --write "$FILE" >/dev/null 2>&1
exit 0
```

### Protected File Guard

Blocks edits to lock files and CI configuration.

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`:**

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/protected-files.sh",
        "name": "protected-file-guard",
        "statusMessage": "Checking file permissions..."
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/protected-files.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
FILE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')
[ -z "$FILE" ] && exit 0

PROTECTED_PATTERNS=(
  "package-lock.json"
  "yarn.lock"
  "pnpm-lock.yaml"
  ".github/workflows/*"
  ".gitlab-ci.yml"
)

for PATTERN in "${PROTECTED_PATTERNS[@]}"; do
  if [[ "$FILE" == $PATTERN ]]; then
    echo "Blocked: $FILE is a protected file" >&2
    exit 2
  fi
done

exit 0
```

### Desktop Notification

Sends a macOS notification when Qoder CLI needs attention.

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.local.json`:**

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/notify.sh",
        "name": "desktop-notify",
        "async": true
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/hooks/notify.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TITLE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.title // "Qoder CLI"')
MSG=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.message // "Notification"')

if command -v osascript &>/dev/null; then
  osascript -e "display notification \"$MSG\" with title \"$TITLE\""
elif command -v notify-send &>/dev/null; then
  notify-send "$TITLE" "$MSG"
fi
exit 0
```

### Type-Check Gate

Uses an agent to verify TypeScript compiles after edits.

**`${QODER_CONFIG_DIR}/settings.json`:**

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "agent",
        "prompt": "Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and check for type errors in the edited file. If there are errors, report them. $ARGUMENTS",
        "tools": ["Bash", "Read"],
        "if": "Edit(*.{ts,tsx})",
